Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

class Solution {
    public int countPalindromicSubsequence(String s) {
        int[] R = new int[26];
        for (char u : s.toCharArray()) {
            R[u - 'a']++;
        }
        int[] L = new int[26];
        HashSet<Integer> S = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int t = s.charAt(i) - 'a';
            R[t]--;
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                if (L[j] > 0 && R[j] > 0) {
                    S.add(26 * t + j);
                }
            }
            L[t]++;
        }
        return S.size();
    }
}
